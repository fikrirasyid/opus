#### Opus is WordPress theme which focuses on content.
#### The rest is secondary.

## The Origin

The development of Opus was started in 2013: I was looking for a (free) theme and all available options I could find are either too complicated or have particular edge case that I couldn't compromise. So I decided to make one on my own: a theme that focuses on content, incredible clean, and worthy to be released on WordPress Theme repository.

Hence Opus was born. [Opus is my first theme on WordPress repository.](http://wordpress.org/themes/opus)

## The Goals

Opus is made with these goals in mind:

1. **Opus should look great on mobile screen.**
Traffic from mobile start to surpass desktop traffic. There's no question on this. Mobile UX deserves priority as much as desktop UX.
2. **Opus should efortlessly work out of the box**
Many themes requires you to configure stuff to make it looks like its demo. Once you install and activate Opus, it's already looks the way it looks on the demo page.
3. **Opus should allow its user to express themselves**
Everyone is unique. Opus allows you to express your preference by choosing color accents and header image.
4. **Opus should work effortlessly**
It really annoys me when the content I published looks misplaced due to technical issue. Opus is developed to detect your content's quirkiness and adjust it on the fly.
5. **Opus is all about GREAT reading experience.**
I've blogged since 2008. I've written a lot. I want those posts to be read effortlessly.

## The Theme
Here's how Opus looks like:

## Changelogs

#### July 13th, 2014 - v1.1.0

Seven months after its inception to WordPress repository, there are some stuffs that I think need to be added, tweaked, and fixed. Hence the version 1.1:

- Hiding top navigation when the page user scrolls down the page. Display the top navigation when the user scrolls up the page. Saving screen space for more important focus: the content. Inspired by [this article](https://medium.com/@mariusc23/hide-header-on-scroll-down-show-on-scroll-up-67bbaae9a78c)
- Adding support for Infinite Scroll feature provided by Jetpack
- Adding support for [WP-IG, the Instagram - WordPress integration plugin](https://github.com/fikrirasyid/wp-ig)
- Displaying embed code, oEmbed-supported link, or url to video stored on post meta '_format_video_embed' as video on single page. Note: I recommend [Crowd Favorite's wp-post-format plugin for better UX for post format](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-post-formats)
- Subtle improvement on design: smaller content width to make featured image on post format image more digestable, changing typography from open sans to roboto (IMO it is more sharper especially when it is used on large font-size), adding parallax effect to page image cover, adding subtle shadow to give sense of depth to the layout, inspired by [Android Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
- Hiding tag box if there's no tag to be displayed
- Fixing top nav behavior on small screen
